					MEBAâ€™s foundry produces various metal castings. We specialise in common metals processing including aluminium 
					and cast iron. However, we do use other metals as well, such as bronze, brass, steel, magnesium, and zinc to 
					produce castings in our foundry. We can form virtually any shape and size.

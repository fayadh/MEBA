				MEBAâ€™s foundry produces various metal castings. We specialise in common metals processing including aluminium 
				and cast iron. However, we do use other metals as well, such as bronze, brass, steel, magnesium, and zinc to 
				produce castings in our foundry. We can form virtually any shape and size.

				In a Foundry, pattern is a replica of the object to be cast, used to prepare the cavity into which molten 
				material will be poured during the casting process.
				</div>

				Patterns used in sand casting may be made of wood, metal, plastics or other materials. Patterns are made 
				to exacting standards of construction, so that they can last for a reasonable length of time, according 
				to the quality grade of the pattern being built, and so that they will repeatably provide a dimensionally 
				acceptable casting.<br><br>
